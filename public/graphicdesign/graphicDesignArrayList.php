Each year features a specially designed logo of the zodiac animal, an invitation, reply card, envelopes, and program book. Two custom patterns accompany the logo as part of the year's branding and are inspired by Chinese paper-cutting. Of the twelve zodiac animals, I've designed seven so&nbsp;far.",

The magazine's logo, 'east', is a streamlined design inspired by the red sun of the Japanese flag. A table of contents, letter from the editor, and two feature articles (copy and photos were sourced from the web and edited as needed) were also designed. In addition to the main project, I also created a local site to present the final mockups in a video to the professor. The project, from concept and research to finished files and presentation, was completed in a total of 4&nbsp;weeks.",
